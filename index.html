                <p>
                    Peace of Christ. My name is Paul, I am from West-Africa. I would like to encourage you to investigate the faith which has been handed down to us.<br><br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I cannot describe the joy I felt when I discovered these
                    works of the post-apostolic followers of the Lord Jesus. I
                    was ignorant and had been thinking that <strong>the history of the faith</strong>
                    might be about Roman Catholicism or adulterated things. Yet, to
                    my big astonishment, it was anything save that. Praise God they
                    were Catholic __ geographically diverse yet doctrinally identic (Lyon, Carthage, Alexandria, Antioch, Rome, Smyrna, ...) rendering the same testimony to the Lord through matyrdom in the midst of tribulations and persecutions, none of them claimed
                    to be anything save disciples who with much trembling sought to
                    be like their Master __ but not Roman Catholic. <br><br> I thank God for
                    the grace of being able to have in our possession these works of those who have been
                    successors, nay co-workers with the very apostles of the
                    Lord Jesus, so be able to discover their love for the Word of God even
                    Christ, for all the saints as their apostles praised in the Scriptures, their
                    testimonies, their passion, their implemention of the
                    commandments of the Lord, their dealings with the world,
                    with the heathens, with the philosophers, with the heretics, their matyrdoms, their love for each other, etc. May the
                    Lord Jesus grant renewal and repentance to all believers
                    everywhere!
